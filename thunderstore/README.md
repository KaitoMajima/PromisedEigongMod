# Promised Eigong - Nine Sols Mod

**“A retelling of Eigong's fight at the height of her determination and abilities in her quest to reach immortality.”**  
An extraordinarily challenging total rework of Eigong's boss fight.


**Promised Eigong** is a mod that dramatically increases the difficulty and intensity of Eigong, the final boss of Nine Sols. It introduces new AI behaviors, attack patterns, and game rules that
serve as a new challenge for people who love the challenge that Eigong brings.

# Phase 2

# Config Settings
## Challenge
- **LVL0Challenge** : (STILL WIP) For now, all this does is make the fire damage more forgiving. Makes lvl 0 challenges a little more bearable. Full lvl 0 support coming soon.
- **ShufflerChallenge** : Shuffles every attack transition as an added challenge to prevent AI manipulation.

## Debug
- **AutoSkipHub** : Auto skip New Kunlun Control Hub if you're playing an Eigong save outside of MoB.
- **IsUsingHotReload** : Do not turn this on unless you are developing on this mod.

## Graphics
- **High Contrast Eigong**: If you're having trouble with Eigong's visibility in Phase 3, toggle this ON and she should have more contrast with the background.
- **General Mod Graphics**: Change here the settings of the mod's graphics if you're having performance issues.
- **Sprite Flasher Strength**: The strength value in which Eigong's sprite will flash when hit. From 0 to 1, 0 does not flash at all, while 1 flashes the strongest.
